# talks
Repository for content that I might present out in the world

If I gave a talk at some point, I'm going to try to put the content here from now on.

If you saw me give a talk and expected the content to be here and it is not, let me know so I can fix that.  Or maybe I lost the content.  Either way, might as well ping me.
